Plane Management System
This project is a Java-based application designed to manage and track seat reservations for a private plane. ​ The system includes the following features:
Features

Seat Management: Uses standard arrays to track seat availability (0 for available, 1 for sold). ​
User Menu: Provides a menu for users to interact with the system, including options to buy, cancel, and find seats.
Buy Seat: Allows users to purchase a seat by specifying the row and seat number. ​
Cancel Seat: Enables users to cancel a seat reservation. ​
Find First Available Seat: Searches for the first available seat starting from row A to D.
Show Seating Plan: Displays the current seating plan, indicating available and sold seats. ​
Person Class: Stores personal information (name, surname, email) of the ticket holder. ​
Ticket Class: Stores ticket information (row, seat, price) and links to a Person object. ​
Ticket Management: Includes ticket creation, storage, and cancellation.
Print Tickets Information: Prints information of all sold tickets and calculates the total price. ​
Search Tickets: Searches for a ticket based on row and seat number and displays the ticket and person information. ​
Save Tickets: Saves ticket information to a file named after the row and seat number. ​

This project demonstrates the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms to effectively manage seat reservations for a private plane.
